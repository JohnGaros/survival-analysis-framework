# Predictions Output

This directory contains CSV files with survival probability predictions generated by the trained models.

## File Format

Each prediction CSV contains:
- `account_entities_key`: Account identifier
- `model_name`: Name of the best-performing model used
- `expected_survival_months`: Expected survival time in months (restricted mean survival time)
- `survival_prob_3m`: Survival probability at 3 months
- `survival_prob_6m`: Survival probability at 6 months
- `survival_prob_12m`: Survival probability at 12 months
- `survival_prob_18m`: Survival probability at 18 months
- `survival_prob_24m`: Survival probability at 24 months
- `survival_prob_36m`: Survival probability at 36 months

## Interpretation

**Expected Survival Months:**
- Represents the average time (in months) that an account is expected to remain active
- Calculated as the area under the survival curve (restricted mean survival time)
- Higher value = lower risk of termination
- Typical range: 15-96 months in the sample data

**Survival Probabilities:**
- Survival probability at time t represents P(survival time > t)
- This is the probability that the account remains active beyond time t
- Values range from 0 to 1 (0% to 100%)
- Higher probability = lower risk of termination at that time point

## Example Risk Profiles

**Low Risk Account (High Survival):**
- Expected survival: ~96 months
- 12-month survival: 99.6%
- 36-month survival: 97.7%

**High Risk Account (Low Survival):**
- Expected survival: ~15 months
- 12-month survival: 54.8%
- 36-month survival: 3.9%
