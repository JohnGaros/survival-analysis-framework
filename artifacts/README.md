# artifacts/

## Purpose

Training artifacts generated by the survival modeling pipeline.

## Contents

- `model_metrics.csv` - Per-fold metrics for all models (C-index, IBS)
- `model_summary.csv` - Aggregated metrics and rankings
- `{model_name}/` - Model-specific subdirectories with:
  - `fold_{k}_survival_preds.csv` - Survival function predictions per fold
  - Additional model-specific outputs

## Generation

Artifacts are created automatically when running:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

Integration tests also generate artifacts in `data/test_outputs/artifacts/`.

## Git Status

**Gitignored** - These are reproducible outputs, not source files.

## Cleanup

```bash
# Remove all artifacts
rm -rf artifacts/

# Regenerate by running pipeline
python src/main.py
```

## Usage

```python
import pandas as pd
metrics = pd.read_csv('artifacts/model_metrics.csv')
summary = pd.read_csv('artifacts/model_summary.csv')
```
