  - Fit final models for completed models only
  - Generate predictions using best available model
  - Send comprehensive recovery notifications
- **Status**: ✅ **Fully Implemented in src/survival_framework/recovery.py**

## Implementation Summary

All features from these planning documents have been successfully implemented:

**Code Changes:**
- `src/survival_framework/recovery.py` - 450+ lines, automatic recovery orchestration
- `src/survival_framework/train.py` - Incremental persistence, safe MLflow wrappers
- `src/survival_framework/tracking.py` - Safe wrapper functions
- `src/main.py` - Recovery integration in exception handler
- `requirements.txt` - Added filelock>=3.12

**Testing:**
- Recovery system tested with partial metrics (3/5 models)
- Verified detection, summary generation, model fitting, predictions
- Production-ready with comprehensive logging

**Impact:**
- 31-hour runs can now produce usable predictions even if last model fails
- Incremental persistence prevents total data loss
- MLflow failures no longer crash pipeline
- Automatic logs directory creation for production runs
